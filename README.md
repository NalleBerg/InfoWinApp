This is a simple system information program I made to learn Python. I am working together with any AI that would answer, but mostly wirt Aria (Opera's AI), Deep Seek and GitHub, the one you'll find in Visual Studio Community,

This program tries to simplifie the system info. Having as much info as possible there and having live (one seconds polls) info where possible.

The goal is to make the program as informative as possible with help pop-ups for all info.
But I am not there yet :)

The code works fine, but I am still in the process of adding features, so I haven't had time yet to add the explanatory question marks for the help pop-ups.

It's written in Python and python executables can be slow in the start-up since it uses a JIT (Just In Time) compiler. Once it has started it's fast enough.
